# About Me
Hey there!

My name is Pranav Nair. I'm currently pursuing my B.Tech in Electronics and Computers Engineering at Amrita School of Engineering, Amritapuri. 

My interests include volatile memory analysis, reversing (beginner for now), script in python, watch memes and play games. Football is my favourite sport and I support Manchester City(kinda rare lol) hoping one day they will win the Champions League.

I'm currently part of [team bi0s](https://bi0s.in) as a CTF player training under DFIR Analysis. My main focus is on malware analysis as of now since I have no hopes from academics. Mostly focusing on replicating certain malware attacks while learning a bit of reversing along the way as a part of making some projects (and challenges for [InCTFi](https://ctftime.org/event/1370/))

The main aim of this blog is for me to keep track of things that I learnt till now. Keeping it public will force me maintain the whole thing in a proper manner.

Hopefully, I will be able to make posts over here someday.

Peace!
